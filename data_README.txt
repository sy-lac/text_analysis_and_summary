This folder contains all the data used in MLSUM: The Multilingual Summarization Corpus (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14900).

The five langages are:
    - French (fr)
    - German (de)
    - Spanish (es)
    - Turkish (tu)
    - Russian (ru)
    
In the main folder, for each langage you can find three files:
    - [LANG]_metadatas.txt : the raw data including the topic, url, data, title etc. 
    - [LANG]_articles.txt  : the raw article
    - [LANG]_summaries.txt : the raw summaries
    
 
In addition, for each language there is one folder containing the tokenized data split for the test / train / val sets.
